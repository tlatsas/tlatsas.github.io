I recently [found a thread](http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7241817) in ubuntu forums that explained how to get a gnome-like volume indicator in Xfce.

I took this script and polished it a bit. It now features:

* command line parameter for alsa channel
* command line parameter for volume change step
* proper help screen
* proper stock icon names based on the [freedesktop icon naming specification](http://standards.freedesktop.org/icon-naming-spec/icon-naming-spec-latest.html)

You can get the script from here: [alsavol](https://github.com/tlatsas/utils-scripts/blob/master/alsavol).
