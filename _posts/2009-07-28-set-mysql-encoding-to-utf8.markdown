This one troubled me for a long time and it also resulted in a corrupted database at some point, because i changed collation encoding to utf8 but the database encoding was latin. (so always make backups and make sure you don't erase them :P )

Before doing the following make sure you backup any databases as this could possibly corrupt them. If you need to change the encoding of your database data, one possible solution **(not tested)** would be to use mysqldump to dump the database with the latin (or whatever) encoding. Then use the [iconv](http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/documentation/libiconv/iconv.1.html) utility to change that encoding to utf8. After that change mysql encoding to utf8 (as follows) and then import the database with the new encoding.

Another solution **(worked for me)** is to let mysql "autodetect" the database encoding when you dump (mysqldump) and later import the databases.

So to set everything to utf8 encoding in mysql add the following lines to the \[mysqld\] section of my.cnf

{% highlight text %}
init-connect = 'SET NAMES utf8'
character-set-server = utf8
collation-server = utf8_general_ci
default-character-set = utf8
default-collation = utf8_general_ci
{% endhighlight %}

Also you need the following line under the \[client\] section of my.cnf
{% highlight text %}
default-character-set = utf8
{% endhighlight %}

then restart mysql.
You can verify the used encodings by loging in to mysql and running the following commands in cli:

{% highlight text %}
mysql> show variables like '%server%';
mysql> show variables like '%characters%';
mysql> show variables like '%collation%';
{% endhighlight %}
